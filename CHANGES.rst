CHANGES
=======

x.x.x (xxxx-xx-xx)
------------------

* Changed `timeout <= 0` behaviour

  * Backward incompatibility change, prior this version `0` was shortcut for `None`
  * when timeout <= 0 `TimeoutError` raised faster

1.4.0 (2017-09-09)
------------------

* Implement `remaining` property (#20)

  * If timeout is not started yet or started unconstrained:
    `remaining` is `None`
  * If timeout is expired: `remaining` is `0.0`
  * All others: roughly amount of time before `TimeoutError` is triggered

1.3.0 (2017-08-23)
------------------

* Don't suppress nested exception on timeout. Exception context points
